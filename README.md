We at PyJaipur are building our first product. 
If you want to host a coding contest in your college or perhaps in your 
office (maybe even within your family!) this is the product you will need. 

A program to host a programming contest on your laptop. 
The soul purpose of this project is to maximize learning while you develop it. 
Come and join in the development!
