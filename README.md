Coding Contest
==============


We at PyJaipur are building our first product. 
If you want to host a coding contest in your college or perhaps in your 
office (maybe even within your family!) this is the product you will need. 

A program to host a programming contest on your laptop. 
The sole purpose of this project is to maximize learning while you develop it. 
Come and join in the development!


How to Participate
------------------

Participation in this project has two paths. You can write code, and you can review other people's merge requests.

Two write code:

1. Read the [issues](https://github.com/PyJaipur/Project-Coding-Contest/issues) in this project (Issues in the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/PyJaipur/Project-Coding-Contest/labels/good%20first%20issue) label are a good starting point).
2. If you want to work on an issue mention in the issue discussion that you want to work on it. You can collaborate with multiple people on a single issue. Make good use of github's fork and merge mechanism.
3. As soon as you have code which attempts to solve an issue, submit a merge request to the project's master branch.
4. Improve your code as per feedback until the merge request is accepted.
5. Party ðŸŽ‰

To review:

1. Pick up a merge request on the project.
2. Go through the code.
3. If something is not clear, ask for clarification. If someone has already asked just thumbsup that comment.
4. Add an approving comment. If one exists thumbsup on that.
